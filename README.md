# p5.js-generations
This repository is a playground to explore the mesmerizing world of creative coding using p5.js. I've put together some of my interactive art projects and resources that inspire me to blend my passion for coding, math, and art into captivating visual experiences.

# How to use it
You can use the [web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) for p5.js or [download the library](https://p5js.org/download/) too. To make things easier, I used the web editor which already had the index.html and style.css files integrated within. If you'd like to experiment with my code, you can download the sketch.js file and upload it to your p5.js project to use it. For this project (and probably a lot of future ones), I used a CSV file generated by scanning the color palette containing the popular color palettes from [this repository](https://github.com/federico-pepe/nice-color-palettes/tree/master#nice-color-palettes-for-processing). You may download the colors.csv file, use your own color palette with RGB values or generate a random color palette.

# 
And that's it! I hope you enjoy the process of learning and creating unique results using p5.js. I will be uploading more code as I work through them so check back every week!

 
# SQUIGGY LINES (will update name later)
This was a fun project to work on with lots of possibilities for different generations.

# WATERCOLOR BLOB
Inspired by [this Tyler Hobbs video](https://youtu.be/5R9eywArFTE?si=zI5KXgHpkq_Ixydd), I used gaussian distribution to creath "growths" on the polygon and applied it recursively to create a watercolor effect.
